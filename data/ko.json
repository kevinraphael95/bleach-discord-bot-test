    "3": {
      "date": "2021.01.18",
      "question": "Could you give us the details around how you came up with the word “Bankai”?",
      "réponse": "Before the serialization of BLEACH, I tried to use the word “卍殺伏龍砲” (Bansatsu-Fukuryuhō) in another manga, I repurposed it from there."

      "question": "Is there any possibility that unrevealed Zanpakutō or Bankai will be introduced in some form in the future?",

      "question": "In the anime version of BLEACH, the costume designs of some characters such as Soi Fon, Yoruichi-san and Harribel-sama were different from the original work, what did you think about that?",
      "réponse": "Back in those days, there was a rule within Jump that “only works which have finished serialization will be made into late night anime.” However, nowadays you can ask them to broadcast it late at night and stay true to the original work. By the way, ALPHAxOMEGA’s Harribel figurine is based on the original work."

      "réponse": "“Why did you choose Rukia as the hiding place for the Hōgyoku?” Kisuke told him half truth and half lie, but Renji was satisfied with it."
    },
    "12": {
      "date": "2021.01.25",
      "question": "By some chance, I wonder if Kubo-sensei was actually the originator of Whiskrs STORE?",
      "réponse": "I am the originator. This is a brand that aims to put out merchandise in which I am involved in everything from conception to completion."
    },
    "13": {
      "date": "2021.01.25",
      "question": "Tite Kubo-sensei, when you think about a character, do you also think about colors at the same time? Or, how do you decide the colors?",
      "réponse": "It’s pretty much done at the same time. In such cases, the color scheme is determined at the line drawing stage so there is no need to deliberate over how it should look."
    },
    "14": {
      "date": "2021.01.25",
      "question": "What are your favorite sweets?",

      "date": "2021.01.25",
      "question": "Kubo-sensei, could you tell us from your own perspective how to go about creating characters so that readers can empathize with them and find them compelling?",
      "réponse": "What’s important is whether or not that character has a unique mindset which sets them apart from other characters, so it’s not that I think it’s necessary to empathize with a character."
    },
    "16": {
      "date": "2021.01.25",
      "question": "Why is the phrase “nandato” (*“what did you say?”) used so frequently in BLEACH?",
      "réponse": "At the time, there were many works with distinctive catchphrases for characters, so this was an experiment to create a catchphrase for the work rather than the characters, thereby giving the work itself its very own personality. I then put it to work as dialogue that does not compromise the individuality of each character, even when multiple characters are using it."
    },
    "17": {
      "date": "2021.01.25",
      "question": "In BLEACH, “BAD SHIELD UNITED” is brought up as a Human World ‘movie’ but does Mille really end up dying? Since the speaker is Mizuiro, it’s hard to tell whether it’s his usual dark humor towards Keigo or if he’s serious, I’ve been curious about that for quite some time.",
      "réponse": "She dies. My first editor from back then (who was also my editor at the time of BSU) also said to me “I’m shocked though….”"
    },
    "18": {
      "date": "2021.01.25",
      "question": "In BURN THE WITCH, there were often color illustrations which were colored digitally, but around what time did you start trying digital coloring?",
      "réponse": "I started from BTW. As far as the order of things go, the Jump cover for chapter 1 is probably the first one that was done digitally. I was nervous until that issue of Jump came out."
    },
    "19": {
      "date": "2021.02.01",
      "question": "Are there any parts of your characters which make you think \"this is hard to draw.”",
      "réponse": "When it comes to parts, large breasts are all difficult. Also, during the week where Szayelaporro’s release state came up I complained the whole time whilst drawing it."
    },
    "20": {
      "date": "2021.02.01",
      "question": "When I was reading “BURN THE WITCH”, I very often got the impression that Noel was always positioned on the left and Ninny on the right, but I wonder if there’s any significance behind this positional relationship…!?",
      "réponse": "In order to generate an impression of the characters with a limited number of pages, I did this as a sort of staging effect in the sense that ‘a character’s traits are incorporated in their stance.’ You have a good eye…."
